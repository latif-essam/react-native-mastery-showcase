3. **Post Details Screen**:

   - Displays full details of a selected post (title, body, and user ID).
   - Includes "Edit" and "Delete" buttons.
   - "Edit" button navigates to the Edit Post screen.

6. **Theme Toggle**:

   - Allows users to toggle between light and dark themes for a personalized experience.

7. **Settings Screen**:
   - Provides options to configure app settings according to user preferences.

### Navigation

- Utilizes **React Navigation** for smooth screen transitions.

### State Management
